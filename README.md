# Invisible-watermarking-with-no-loss

Python to code to create an invisible watermark. The 'watermark' image is embedded in the 'host' image by storing it in the last 4 bits of each pixel of the host image (the size of the host image must be appropriately larger than the size of the watermark image for this to be done). The 'watermark' hidden in the image can be then extracted with the help of the 'Decoder' code.
